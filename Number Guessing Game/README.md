## Number Guessing Game  

This project is a simple **number guessing game** where the program randomly picks a number and the user must guess it.  
Implemented in **both C and Python**.  


## âœ¨ Features

- Random number generation within a range (1â€“100).  
- Feedback system: tells if the guess is too high or too low.  
- Tracks number of attempts until correct guess.  
- Works with replayable logic in Python version.


## ðŸ“– Sample Output
Example run (C version):

Enter your guess: 50
Too low!
Enter your guess: 80
Too high!
Enter your guess: 73
Correct guess!
You guessed in 3 attempts.
(More examples available in sample_output.txt and for output screenshots visit Screenshots folder)


## ðŸ”‘ Uniqueness

C version demonstrates use of rand() with time() seeding.

Python version leverages random.randint() for simplicity.

Teaches basics of loops, conditionals, and randomness in both languages.
